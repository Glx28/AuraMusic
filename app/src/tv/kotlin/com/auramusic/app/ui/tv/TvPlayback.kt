/**
 * How anything on a television decides what playing something actually means.
 *
 * There are two kinds of thing a shelf can hold and they are not played the same
 * way. A song goes into the music queue and plays. A video is a video: it is handed
 * to the video pipeline, which resolves its stream and puts it on the player as a
 * video, so the picture is there from the first frame.
 *
 * Queuing a video as music and switching a video in afterwards is what this exists
 * to stop doing. That route starts as an audio item and then goes looking for a
 * video to put in its place, so every video arrives as sound first, a gap, then the
 * picture it was always going to show - on the home screen, in search, in a shelf,
 * everywhere alike, because it was not a property of where the video was found but
 * of how it was played.
